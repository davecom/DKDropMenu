# DKDropMenu
DKDropMenu is a simple iOS drop down list written in Swift. It expands and collapses. It allows the user to select only one item at a time. Items are just Strings. A delegate is notified when selection occurs. DKDropMenu is IBDesignable and IBInspectable with customizable colors, font, and row heights.

## Installation
Use the cocoapod `DKDropMenu` or simply include `DKDropMenu.swift` in your project. DKDropMenu 0.2.0 requires Swift 3. Use DKDropMenu 0.1.6 for Swift 2 support.

## Usage
Create a DKDropMenu in IB or in code (using UIView's init methods). Then add items and set a delegate:
```
dropMenu.add(names: ["hello", "goodbye", "why?"])
dropMenu.delegate = self
```
Make sure to implement the single method the delegate (DKDropMenuDelegate) must implement:
```
func itemSelected(withIndex: Int, name: String) {
    println("\(name) selected");
}
```
The delegate can also optionally implement the method 
```
func collapsedChanged()
```
to be notified when the collapse status of the menu changes.

Items can be added or removed 
```
func add(names: [String])
func add(name: String)
func remove(atIndex: Int)
func remove(name: String)
func removeAll()
```
The properties `collapsed` (Bool) and `selectedItem` (String) can be manually modified.
